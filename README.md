🩺 Health Lanka – A National Digital Health Profile System
Health Lanka is a digital healthcare platform developed to give every citizen of Sri Lanka a unique digital health profile. The system is designed to store and manage a person’s medical history, allowing doctors and healthcare providers to access accurate and up-to-date information at any time, anywhere in the country.
